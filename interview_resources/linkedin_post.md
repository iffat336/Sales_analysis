# 🚀 Project Launch: Full-Stack Sales Analytics Dashboard

I’m excited to share my latest project, **Sales Analysis Dashboard**, now live! 📊

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://salesanalysis-vbma5akgqx7bmpljorrd3t.streamlit.app/

## 💡 The Problem
Raw transactional data from Excel files is often hard to interpret. I wanted to build a system that transforms 400,000+ rows of raw retail data into actionable insights—revenue trends, top markets, and customer behavior.

## 🛠 The Tech Stack
This wasn't just a visualization task; I built a complete **Full-Stack Application** from scratch:

*   **Database**: Designed a normalized **SQL** schema (SQLite) to ensure data integrity and query performance.
*   **Backend**: Built a high-performance REST API using **FastAPI** to serve data and analytics endpoints.
*   **Frontend**: Created two interfaces:
    1.  A custom **Glassmorphism Dashboard** using Vanilla JS & Chart.js.
    2.  A python-native **Streamlit App** for rapid cloud deployment.
*   **DevOps**: Containerized the entire application with **Docker** and automated deployment via **GitHub**.

## 📈 Key Features
*   **Real-time Analytics**: Monthly sales trends and "Top 10 Customers" calculated on the fly via SQL aggregations.
*   **Interactive UI**: Dynamic filtering and responsive charts.
*   **Architecture**: Decoupled frontend/backend design for scalability.
